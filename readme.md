# Outdoor Competition Meetups

Outdoor Competition Meetups is a web application developed with .NET Core Web API for the back-end and React for the front-end. This application serves as a platform for creating, managing, and participating in outdoor sporting events. Our aim is to connect event organizers, participants, and spectators in a single, easy-to-use space.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Server**: The server-side of the app is a .NET MVC application responsible for all the backend operations such as handling requests, managing data, business logic, etc.

2. **Client-app**: The client-side of the app is a React application responsible for the front-end user interface.

## Features

- **Event Creation**: Users can create events for a wide range of outdoor sports including mountain bike races, whitewater rafting races, ski and snowboard competitions, and more.
  
- **Event Sign Up**: Users can sign up for the events they are interested in, either as participants or spectators.
  
- **User Interaction**: This application acts as a bridge between event organizers, participants, and spectators, facilitating their interaction and communication.
